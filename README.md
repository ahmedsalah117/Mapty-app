# Mapty-app


"Mapty" is a web application that I developed as part of the Javascript Complete Guide course on Udemy. 

The application was mainly developed to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Javascript and proved to be a great exercise in that regard. 

The application allows users to track their running or cycling activities using the Leaflet library to display a map and the geolocation API to determine the user's coordinates and display them on the map. 

Users can input information about their activities, such as the type of activity, duration, distance, and other relevant data using a form. Once the user submits the form, the activity is recorded and displayed on the map.

To further enhance the user experience, I also implemented local storage functionality, which saves the user's activity data in the browser's local storage.
This means that even if the user reloads the page or closes the browser, their activity data will still be available.

Overall, "Mapty" is an excellent demonstration of my proficiency in OOP in Javascript and my ability to apply the concepts learned in the course to real-world scenarios.
The project showcases my skills in developing practical web applications using modern technologies.
